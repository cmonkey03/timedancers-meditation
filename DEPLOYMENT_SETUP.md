# 🚀 Simple Deployment Setup Guide

This guide sets up automated testing for the TimeDancers Meditation app using GitHub Actions, with deployment handled entirely by Expo's GitHub integration.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ GitHub repository with admin access
- ✅ Expo account ([expo.dev](https://expo.dev))
- ✅ Expo project already configured (you have `eas.json`)

## 🎯 Step 1: Install Expo GitHub App

1. Go to [Expo GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/expo)
2. Click **Install** or **Configure**
3. Select your repository (`timedancers-meditation`)
4. Grant necessary permissions

**That's it for deployment!** Expo will automatically:

- ✅ Run build checks on PRs
- ✅ Build and submit to App Store/Play Store on main branch merges
- ✅ Handle EAS Updates for over-the-air updates

## 🧪 Step 2: Your Testing Workflows

The GitHub Actions workflows are already set up and **require no tokens**:

### **E2E Tests** (`e2e-tests.yml`)

- **Triggers**: Push to `develop` only
- **Tests**: Full meditation app functionality
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **No setup required** - works immediately

### **PR Checks** (`pr-checks.yml`)

- **Triggers**: PRs to `main`
- **Tests**: Unit tests + linting
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes
- **No setup required** - works immediately

## 🔄 Your Development Flow

Feature Branch → develop (Full E2E Tests) → PR to main (Quick Checks) → Merge (Expo Deploys)

### **1. Push to `develop`**

- ✅ Full E2E tests run automatically
- 🧪 Tests all meditation features (chakra orbs, timer, volume controls)
- 📱 iOS simulator testing

### **2. Create PR to `main`**

- ✅ Quick unit tests + linting
- ✅ Expo GitHub app adds build status checks
- 📊 PR shows all test results

### **3. Merge to `main`**

- ✅ Expo automatically builds for App Store/Play Store
- ✅ Expo automatically submits for review
- ✅ EAS Update provides instant updates to existing users

## 🎉 You're Ready

Your TimeDancers Meditation app now has:

- ✅ **Automated Testing**: E2E tests on develop, quick checks on PRs
